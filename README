Gem to Arch is a program for automatically creating a
PKGBUILD for the Arch package management system from
a yaml file of gem specifications

$ gem2arch gem version

will dump the PKGBUILD to the screen. Remember that you
need to download the yaml file beforehand from
 http://gems.rubyforge.org/yaml
which can be done using:
 wget http://gems.rubyforge.org/yaml
or any download manager you like.
